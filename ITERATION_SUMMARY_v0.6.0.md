# Echo Adventure v0.6.0 - Iteration Summary

**Date**: November 17, 2025
**Version**: 0.6.0

This iteration introduces a fully autonomous self-improvement loop, powered by a new LLM-based corpus generator. The model can now monitor its own cognitive state, generate high-quality training data, and continuously evolve its identity.

## Key Achievements

- **LLM-Based Corpus Generation**: Replaced template-based generation with a sophisticated LLM-powered system for more nuanced and contextual training data.
- **Autonomous Self-Improvement Loop**: Integrated monitoring, reflection, generation, and regulation into a continuous, self-driven cycle.
- **Multi-Turn Conversation Generation**: Enabled the creation of deeper, more exploratory conversational examples.
- **LLM-Based Quality Assessment**: Implemented a new quality assurance mechanism using LLM evaluation to ensure a high-quality training corpus.

## New Modules

- `src/echo_adventure/llm_corpus_generator.py`: Advanced corpus generation using real language models.
- `src/echo_adventure/autonomous_loop.py`: The complete, integrated autonomous self-improvement loop.
- `examples/echoself_v0.6.0_demo.py`: A comprehensive demonstration of all new v0.6.0 features.
